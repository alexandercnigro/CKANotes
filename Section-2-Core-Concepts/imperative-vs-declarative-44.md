- imperative
    - giving a set of instructions to arrive at the desired state
    - in k8s, this would be using the CLI to perform actions such as:
        - creating pods via `kubectl run`
        - creating deployments via `kubectl create`
        - editing deployments via `kubectl edit`
    - good for quick changes
    - bad for keeping track of what was changed
    
- declarative
    - giving the desired state and letting the system figure out how to get there
    - in k8s, this would be using yaml files to define your object, then using `kubectl apply` to do exactly what is stated
